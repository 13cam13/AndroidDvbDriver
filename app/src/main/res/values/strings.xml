        Thank you for installing DVB-T Driver. Please note that this app is not meant to be used manually.
        It is automatically used by other apps in order to control USB DVB-T devices such as the RTL2832U.
        You can now close this window and launch your favourite TV app that uses DVB-T Driver.
